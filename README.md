FilmDB - Milestone 3 Project

My Milestone project has been created as a combination of the 3 modules in the Python series of the Full Stack Developer course. These include
Python Fundamentals, Practical Python and Data Centric Development. Using the knowledge from these 3 modules, I have created a responsive
web application using the CRUD functionailty. CRUD which stands for Create, Read, Update and Delete allows the user to add information to the application. It has been designed for users who have a shared love of movies and tv to help create an open source database between fans of the small and big screen.


### Project Goals


## User Goals

* This website has been designed with a target audience of movie and tv enthusiasts. They can share what they think of what they see in todays visual entertainment market. A fan can watch any type of movie they want excluding adult material films and upload information about it. If it's a multi million pound oscar winner that's designed to showcase the talents of a new or existing director, a multi million pound movie which unfortunately flops even with an incredible cast list all the way down to a free handheld open new movie by an unknown director whose starting their career. They've put their heart and soul into the film and shared it on YouTube, the users at FilmDB can watch it, review and share the film for others to see. I want this to be a totally immersible experience for anyone and it all stems from the most passionate of the small and large screen art form. The website is an open source application and technically built by the users to create word and mouth of everything they see.

* Users all over the world will be able to access the site and so the choices can come from anywhere. UK, America, Foreign Films from Germany, Norway or the Middle East. Anyone can use the site to put their opinion down.

* This will then lead to people having a much wider variety of category and what they watch and so they're not watching a set category all the time. Their viewing opinions can be broadened if wanted to something they might never have thought about before but someones review of a film will spark that users interest. A new foreign film set in Sweden about drugs or an American art house piece about a lonely city in Texas. Who knows what the user will discover.

* FilmDB will hopefully be a great place to start their journey into something new. Help bring new directors to peoples screens to help bring new stories to life and not just endless remakes or constant sequels. Fast and Furious anyone!!



Design 


![]()

* This Milestone 3 project is named FilmDB (Film DataBase). It's a API that allows user to be able to add content to a website with a functional 
databse at the backend. It's designed with fans of screen entertainment in mind who want to contribute to a working site to improve other 
users knowledge on Films and TV. Due to the amount of information on the website, there are multiple pages to allow interactivity in various 
categories. There's also a Sign Up/ register and Log in page which a user will need to do in order to add content to the site. The data they 
enter will be stored in the Database at the back end and this is the creative idea behind FilmDB. There will also be a page for moderators 
and the option for someone to become a moderator will be setup. Moderators will be fans and so they will end up having a valued input behind
 the website helping it to be ran by fans for fans.A moderator will keep an eye for bad language in a review. A bad review is acceptable but 
 we want this website to be used by all ages and so if a child stumbles across a review done by an adult that contains foul language, this 
 will be removed from the website under the Terms and Conditions.

[My page]()

* A website built for Film and TV lovers that can share their passion!!

* The project I’ve designed is for my third milestone project for the Data Centric Development module of the Full Stack Developer Course. I’ve used Flask and Python to design the majority layout of the website. This is to provide functionality and sits within the HTML shell with added elements of CSS to add styling. JavaScript and JQuery have been used for
  the. This is a Multi Page Applciation Film Database website. Users are able to login to a Mongo Database which works in conjunction with Heroku and WTForms.There's an API in the background that allows the user to search for Films, TV and Casting of screen entertainment. There's a an option to become a mediator who have the option where a fan can makie sure that the website is being ran properly and is friendly for users of all ages.

## Project Design

* I like to design my web sites with a bold image as a key feature. So much can be told from that image and when a user first lands on a page. The image is instantly recognisable and sets the design and tone of the entiere website. I like to build my designs around the image and this includes the colour scheme, the fonts and the entire layout of the page. I chose strong clear images including great characters from movies and TV. Whether that character is from a classic film or a well structured TV show, they makes a lasting impression on the audience. 

* I chose a floating menu instead of a Nav bar because it gave the page something else. It's been hard to get the layout working with the menu but I believe it was a great feature to add.

### Design


* As you can see in the wireframes section further down, I kept pretty close to my original design. I tried various colour schemes for the heading title but I wanted something that worked well with the background images and seemed to fit with any colour of any image. Whether this was the image of Ripley, the image of or an image like, the Red and Black gradient colour looked great in both it's colour choice and as a header. The white coloured font stood better in the header comapred to black or grey which lost something when I made th image opaque.

I looked at other sites that had a similar theme to mine and I felt mine was different enough to stand out and be something completely new and fresh and to look cool to a user.

I had to think how to showcase the site to a user and tried to make it engaging from the moment the user clicks on the first page.

### Colours

* For the most part, the images used create the colour scheme themsleves. A bold image was chosen to add a poster effect. Then, I chose a colour scheme that would sit well on top of the images and so a white font used for all the wording. A Red and Black gradient used as the main header of the website.



### Images

* Each image chosen was used as they were instantly recognisable pictures from cineman and TV in the past 40 to 50 years. The target audience will range in variation and so I had to think of something that was striking, not a frightening image for smaller children but cool enough to bring people to the site. The images I chose I believe represented this idea very well and the options chosen stood out in the overall design of the site. 

### Styling

* I like the applications I design to be clean without being over the top and so I did the same with this. No over wording on the pages, just something to get you started.

* they click on location. They have 3 climbs they can experience with Design and 
  Conquer. It's just quick to use.

* To get a taste of what the site offers, if they choose "Information" on the back of the flipped image, some content on the modal which pops up explains 
* what the adventure holds in store. There's also a video which when clicked 
  showcases a users experience of that holiday. Once watched and chosen, they can go to the "What We Do and How to Book" below the header which again, 
  showcases a users video with various adventures into a showreel. There's then a "Booking Here" button under the video which displays
  a booking form. The user can fill it in with some brief information and once done, they click on the "Submit" button and that's when the holiday
  organisers go to work. I was trying to keep everything minimal but engaging without headache and I had to think of each step of the users
  experience.

### Fonts

* I tried and tested various fonts for the site. At the beginning, I had 20 fonts all in one page and over a 2 hour period, tried each one.
  I found the Barrio font to be perfect for the header. Off key, scribbled a little, not quite neat enough. A holiday adventurers font.
  When reviewed within peer review in Slack, the feedback on the font choice was very positive.

* The second font I used, Megrim was again chosen from a long list of font choices. I thought it was cool, sharp and fitted in well with the design 
  of the site. I used this for the smaller content fonts in the modals and it's response wasn't as good so I chose to use it as the smaller headings 
  and description font.

* My third main font used was Oxygen. This was clear, concise and fitted neatly into the modals and all readable sections. 

 * Each font chosen wasn't done on a whim. I started off as explained with around 20 fonts each time I tried something new. Tested and had them all reviewed
   and listened to the response of colleagues, friends, family and then my mentor and reviewers from the peers section in Slack. Each review helped
   me select the font options I have used as they have been postiviely received in each use and instance.


### UX

- I drew up various mock wireframes and initially had a a jumobotron header with a white background and then the 9 images on top. 
- It wasn't bold enough and so a single blown up image with a colourful picture I feel gives it a much bigger impact when viewed by
- a user.


### Project Goals

![](/assets/images/flipimage1.jpg) 


* The primary goal of Design and Conquer is a single page application where a user can book an adventure holiday. As the title indicates, the user
  is able to "design" the adventure and then "conquer" it. There are 9 options on the home page to choose from but an optional form is under the
  What We Do? section where a user can change choose a holiday if needed. The user can watch videos on each slide and read information about the 
  location. There's also a Help Guide on the home page which explains the website and how to use it.


### User Objects

* The website has been designed for people that want to try a new type of holiday that's not on the normal scale. It's also designed for people
 who want to add to their list of adventures.

* Aimed at thrill seekers and people who have a passion for the extraordinary, this site can be used to find that thrill of the unknown. The goals of
  the site are:

* Starting that adventure
* Finding that thrill
* Easy to use
* A clean and neat home page with easily findable information
* Bright and engaging for the user
* Striking images and easily readable content
* Watchable videos that can help a user see what they can achieve

### Design and Conquer helps a user find their passion because:

* The design of the site is to showcase whats available via visual content with description. This helps the user to see what they will
 be able to do when they book the holiday.
 
* It's easy to navigate and book the adventure they want to try. A helpful handy guide is prominent on the home page to stop any confusion.
 Images and map markers showcase the central point and locations so the user know where their adventures take place.


### Developers Objects

* Well stuctured and content friendly with well thought out programming.
* The layout is formatted in a way that the user can navigate around the site without frustration.
* A professionally layed out single page application with includes JavaScript, some JQuery, complex HTML and CSS.
* A site that the developer would use themselves and I will be using the format again for other clients. It will be a forefront of his portfolio.

### Future plans

* Offer more holiday destinations by expanding the adventures and portfolio
* Showcase more self made videos from users about their experiences
* More dynamic script in the JavaScript

### User Stories

* As a user aged between 16 and upwards, I want:

1. The objectives to be met when using the site so there's no confusion and it's easy to navigate around the page.

2. As it's a single page application, I wanted the modals to hold more information and allow me to move around and find new content without leaving
   the page. I was able to showcase more using this technique through visual images and video.

3. As for the vidoes I used for the website, they again displayed so much in a single piece of visual content more than words could. Somebody stepping
   off the plane into the blue. A boat ride out to the sea to be within 2 metres of a Great White Shark. The unbelievable surf of Banzai's coast.
   It engaged me, gave me the thrill to get on the plane and try that adventure for myself and in turn the audience. I could visualise and imagine 
   the destination.

4. Visual images before the box flipped shows you instantly what the adventure is going to be.

5. Stunning videos with inspriing music are used as mentioned before to really showcase the adventure.
 
6. 'The Location' is pinpointed to the central point of the holiday. Seperate markers on the map shows locations where you choose your adventure.


### For the user

1. I want them to find the site enjoyable and engaging.

2. I want it to hold enough information without being too confusing to use. 

3. The idea behind the site is, they find the destination by watching the videos and then contacting us. I travelled to New York this year and
   I went to Virgin (other holiday booking companies are available) to book it. I found going to see them was such a constructive experience. They
   located the hotel, the best places to visit, the sites to see and helped make the entire experience easier before I'd left the travel agents. The 
   idea behind Design and Conquer is the user visits the site, chooses their adventure and contacts the organiser of the site. The organiser then 
   helps to "design" the package which would include travelling, accomodation and insurances. That way, the user would only then need to worry about
   packing their clothes and personal neccesities. Again, the idea behind the site is the user can "see something", "like something" and "choose something". 
   The organiser then puts together options with the user to "design" a personal experience.

4. This design I am also using to create other websites for 2 other companies. 

5. As I will be using the website on my portfolio, easy to find contact information will also be displayed on the site for a user to find.


### Original wireframe concepts

* The wireframes below were the original design I had in mind. A bold header and the images were to be sat on a blank background. How I visualised
  it and how it showed were very different and it was much duller on screen. The images which hadn't been chosen at the time might have brought it 
  into a better light but I reviewed other sites and they either had a similar design or something more dramatic.

* Original Full Screen Design

<p align="center">
  <img width="400" height="400" src="/assets/wireframes/originalFSwireframe.png">
</p>

* Original Ipad Design

<p align="center">
  <img width="400" height="400" src="/assets/wireframes/originalipadwframe.png">
</p>

* Original Mobile Design

<p align="center">
  <img width="300" height="350" src="/assets/wireframes/orangemob.png">
</p>


* Changing it to a design more along the lines below made an impact straight away. It had colour giving a better overall layout and made
  a difference from the moment I added the background image. Nothing else but that image changed everything. I could then layer over the 
  top of it and add my original plan. I was able to build from the bottom up and show something more with imagery.

* Full Screen Design - Displays great, really happy with the results and it's responsness. Splits as it should when minimised.

<p align="center">
  <img width="400" height="400" src="/assets/wireframes/Newfswireframe.png">
</p>

* Ipad Design - Again, looks great. Fit's the tablets great and displays as I wanted it too.

<p align="center">
  <img width="400" height="400" src="/assets/wireframes/ipadnewwf.png">
</p>

* Mobile Design - The only slight issue which I wasn't able to rectify no matter how many screen changes I made was the smaller pixel 
  sized screen when the images were more centralised and so the skier character wasn't as visible. He is meant to be slightly seen
  on all devices with the images slighlty pulled to the left so he's displayed.

<p align="center">
  <img width="300" height="350" src="/assets/wireframes/mobwireframe.png">
</p>


### Site Features

* When building the original layout, as you can see on the site as it is now, I changed the font to white. It stood out better against
  the blue. Once in place, I could start my concept of building content from one location. I came up with the idea
  of having the flipped image as my original sketch shows. The 9 images and the idea behind the flipped image is at the bottom.
  I think it works well and looks strong on screen.

<p align="center">
  <img width="500" height="250" src="/assets/wireframes/conceptsketch2.png">
</p>

 * To show this as a functioning working project, I attached the following shots below to show the process and fluid nature of the design working.

</p>


### [Home Page](https://github.com/Mattlister/designandconquer)

* Being a SPA, you never leave the one page. You can do everything all in one place and the necessary features come from that starting point.

* All revolving images as stated have a location button which displays the map. The information button holds brief content and a video to watch. 


### Hopes for the website are:

* A user can navigate around the site with ease and simplicity

* The website can be used to find the perfect holiday 

* It allows a user to start their dream and passion

* It's found to be a nice design that allows each user to move around the site comfortably.

* It's clean, clear and easy to use.


 * There will always be bold adventurers looking for something new. Watching the amazing documentary Free Solo, it showcased how far someone
   will go to fill that need and addiction for something different. I wanted this site to be bold, colourful but all in one easy to use
   place. Design and Conquer is a website I was going to add to my portfolio from a few years ago but I neved made it. As a project, I thought this was
   perfect to use for the holiday allowance project for the course and allows me to showcase what I've learnt.


### Technologies Used


* HTML
* CSS 
* Javascript
* [JQUERY](https://jquery.com/)
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/getting-started/introduction/)

* Bootstrap was used to build a solid and yet simple structure which allowed the site to be responsive easily.

* The same IDE was used but it moved from one product supplier of just Cloud 9 to AWS (Amazon) Cloud 9 for all the above languages.
 
* [Google Maps](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation)

* Google maps were used as the maps based software for this project. 

* [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)

* Google was used for stylising the website fonts as it gave me a great selection to choose from. 

* [Favicons](https://www.favicon.cc/)

* Favicons was used for the URL toolbar icon



 [Autoprefixer](https://autoprefixer.github.io/)
 
* Autoprefixer was used to correct issues within the CSS which prevented the page displaying on products using Safari and made sure
  all css prefixes were up to date.

* Microsoft Word - I used this product to crop images which I used for my README.md file.

* Vimeo - Searching on Vimeo allowed me to find a strong video for each holiday selection which have only been used for educational purposes.



### The goals for the website are:

* To be seen as an easy to use resource for a holiday adventurer wanting to try something new. Also, it showcases my working knowledge of various software
  languages which I've learnt during the various sections leading up to the MS2 project.



### This project is the best way to help them achieve these things because:

* The website has one page that has all navigation and options direct from the one page.

### This website is:


* Easy to navigate through.

* Allows the user to work through the site with an easy to understand front end design.
  Provides the user the information they need without it being overwhelming.
  Booking forms and Get in touch forms are clear and concise for when the user wants to book a holiday


### Deployment

* This project was developed using the Cloud9 development software originally and then AWS Cloud9. The data is stored in git using the Cloud9 platform.

* The project was regularly pushed to GitHub repository https://github.com/Mattlister/designandconquer/commits/master and 
  published to GitHub pages using the GitHub settings.

### Deployment to Github

### When deploying Design and Conquer from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Mattlister/designandconquer), I used the following process:

1. Log into GitHub.
2. From the list of GitHub repositories, select Mattlister/designandconquer
3. At the top the page, where the menu items are, you'll see Settings.
4. Once selected, scroll down the page to the GitHub pages section
5. Under Source, click the drop-down menu labelled and select Master Branch
6. When you select Master Branch, the page will automatically be refreshed and Design and Conquer is then deployed.
7. Once done, scroll back down to the GitHub pages section and you will be able to retrieve the link to the deployed website.

### To run the project locally

* For cloning this project from Github: 

1. Choose the following link: [Design and Conquer GitHub repository](https://github.com/Mattlister/designandconquer)
2. Under repository name, select "Clone or download"
3. You'll see Clone in the HTTPs section, copy the URL for the repository.
4. In your own IDE, open Git Bash.
5. Change the current working directory to your location of choice where you'd like the directory to be made.
6. Type the command git clone, and then paste the URL copied in step 3.
7. Then Press Enter and your local clone will be created.


### I used default commands to push to Github such as:

* git status when checking what needed uploading.
* git commit -m "" with the named update between the quotes for anyone reading what changes I made. A short piece of info helps understand
* the changes I make.
* git push -u origin master which then pushes my update and I then need to enter my username and password for security.


### Issues and setbacks whilst building the site and time taken

* This site has been a hard and long slog to work through. I wrote the JavaScript 3 times in various formats. Firstly, I wrote a fetch command which
  was indepth JavaScript code that was meant to display the maps through JSON. I thought the content worked and centralised the locations, but it was 
  the HTML code. It should have pulled data from JSON to add the markers. The code was clean, there were no errors. DevTools was fine and the arrays 
  pulled the data back but.... the maps would not show the markers on the maps provided by HTML. So, back to the drawing board. The second attempt was 
  much more difficult to put together. I had more to workout because, when I added a centralised location to the modal 1, it worked great. Adding modal 
  2 though overwrote the information and so I had to work that out. It took me a week to resolve this through various searches and code checks to stop 
  the data overwriting when new information was added. To achiever this,I had to write all of the code individually for wach working modal and functions. 
  When finished, it was 100% working, it looked good but it was all hard coded and as I was concerned about losing marks and so, onto option number 3. 
  I wrote the project with more dynamic code and I was able to get the markers to display and the maps worked. I was happy with the end results and so 
  I was ready to submit. The JavaScript took a while. For my first attempt, I had extra sessions with my mentor, I had tutors looking and advising but 
  the maps would not display the markers and so moving onto the next way of working produced exactly what I needed. The third options gave me the final 
  code as I wanted it to be.

* This site has set me back a few times with various issues when putting the project in place. But, I have learnt a great deal working on this project, 
  and yes, it has taken me longer but I believe I did create something relatively complicated. I only say this because when researching what I was doing, 
  the answers weren't always obvious to others. I was able to work through this and keep my head up and keep going to produce what I have now.

* One other issue i had was the map was sometimes greyed out. I tried different things to fix it. It would work 9 out of times or 3 would work and 1
  1 wouldn't so I added: google.maps.event.trigger(map, 'resize'); to resolve the issue.


### Testing

* I tested the website half way through the project on Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome and Safari. I was always using Google Chrome and found no issues when 
  using this browser. The website worked to the normal standard on Mozilla Firefox as well. So far, So good. But, On Apple's Safari browser, there were bugs 
  displayed. The images when hovered over as you'll see will flip and they'll be a grdient background with both a Location and Information button on the back.
  When testing in Safari, the image flipped and stayed as the image but a mirrored version. When the buttons did show, it flipped the image back to the originally
  and there was no maps or modals appearing. These are bugs I need to look into but this is a junction I came to mid project.

* Now working safari issue by using the AutoPrefixer software. No more pausing issues on Safari.

* I used Autoprefixer as explained above to resolve the safari issues I had. I also tested on various iphone formats, ipad tablets and laptops. This inclued Macbook
 with Safari and laptops with Windows 10 installed. Tested on various browsers on both laptops to show everything displayed as it should and planned.

* As I mentioned, I've spent a fair amount of time working on the site and so: Peer Review has been a great help to me. Get feedback from fellow programmers is a really 
* helpful way of making I'm working to a high standard. From all walks of coding, alumni, mentors, tutors and peers all reviewed the code, pointed out issues I'd be better 
* to change and work through. Better layout. Better fonts to use. Better styling and to be more aware of the smaller screens. Even more than I was already. Having a coders
  eyes look over my work and spotting potential issues was a great testing tool as they're aware of changes that needed to be made on a high scale.

* I ran all my code through validators on a regular basis as part of my testing. [JSHint](https://jshint.com/), the [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/) and 
  CSS stlying I found to all be of great use to me when I was checking my code. I also used the Jigsaw validator which showed some issues but only as I was using 
  non recognised vendors for some of the display colours and graphics, not because there was an issue with the code itself. [Jigsaw Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator)
 
* Personal testing from family and friends. I had my wife (whose honesty is always sharp) test the site and she was impressed with it. She saw a lot of potentional in what 
  I'd put it together. She showed it to some of her friends and from that, I've been offered a freelance job to produce a site like mine but it's for a cake making business
  which I take as a massive positive and so I've started working on that. 

* A work colleague who did photography and graphics at university and who is also a budding programmerwent through the site. He found the visuals to be very on point and strong
  and the code to be up to date, nice and clean. The images he advised were clear and precise and from a photography point of view, they were striking and detailed.



### Media and Content

* The text, images and videos were found on various sites for each particular venture. 

* The content was taken and used in context from actual sites running these adventures for real and so their write up's were specific for the use of 
  promoting the products.
* The images were searched and found on Google
* The videos were searched for and found on Google. I used Vimeo videos as they're clearer than YouTube videos.


### Code

* I've used various code for this website. As they say, a lazy programmer is a smart programmer so I used some of my code from my 
* MS1 project to start working on this. The Javasctipt was 

* HTML - All code produced by Matthew Lister except for the content such as videos and*  images. These were searched and found on Google Chrome and
then added into iframe and img source code which I had put together. The modal formats and forms were taken from my MS1 and edited to correspond
to the needs of this website. I used script tags from Google Fonts to display the correct formatted fonts.

* CSS - All CSS code was produced by Matthew Lister originally typed to add styling to the HTML page. This included Font styling, image sizing and
colour choices except for the gradients for the back of the flip boxes. This can be found at: http://www.annenbergdl.org/tutorials/easy-breezy-beautiful-css-gradients/
which helps add so much more to the back of the flip boxes. Once I had the code typed up, I ran it through Autoprefixer to clean up and resolve any
breaks which did help in regards to displaying on various sized devices.
 

* JavaScript - The JavaScript took on many forms. All the content was written by myself with some support at various flavours provided by Simen Daehlin,
*              John Lonngately and Shane Muirhead who I've thanked further below but they worked the JavaScript with me at points to improve the layout
*              and the way my code was written. It was always "correct" but I had some points which needed to be neatened up and so fortunately, I had 
*             support helping me to produce greater script.

* JSON within the JavaScript, initially a separate file - The code was produced using information found online on how to produce a JSON file. Once I had 
*             the basis, I added more informtion to the file to hold multiple markers that will display on the map.





### Acknowledgements

* I'd like to say thank you to my mentor Simen Daehlin who has supported me throughout the project and has been a great influence and inspired me to
  keep going. The Slack
  community reviewed my code and pointed out issues/ offered advice to aide me in improving my sites to produce something greater and so I'm 
  really grateful for their consistent support and it's good to know we're in this together. I'd also like to say thank you and acknowledge  for their help in regard to issues I had with my Javascript and JQUERY code. And finally, I'd like to say a big thank you to Anna Greaves and

### For my friends currently working on their Milestone 2 projects.

* I'm happy if youy'd like to use my readme file as a reference and guide as an example of how to write a strucured milestone project. The format will hopefully
  be of use to you but it is not ok to copy directly from mine for your own project. 

* Thank you for your understanding,

### How I’d like the website to be perceived:


* This website would be an easy to use site to help users search for Movies and TV and to share site what they love or hate about their choices.

* They have a keen interest in the silver screen and it's smaller counterpart and this site will help them to share their interests and broaden their knowledge.

* A nice clean UX multi page designed site. Choose your option and start your journey. Show others what you love and help to share that with them.
