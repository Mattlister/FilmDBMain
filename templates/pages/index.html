			<p> At FilmDB (DataBase) WE LOVE MOVIES and we want the same for you.

				FilmDB is a movie and database built by you, the user. The site has been designed as an open source
				website
				where you add the info about your favourite movies to help build FilmDB. You add the reviews, you add
				the films
				you love and so you help build the passion of the website.

				We hope your contributions will help others to learn about movies and find something new. We welcome all
				and
				encourage everyone to use the platform of this site to help build the world of movies.

				As an independent site, reviewers contributions are golden and we would love everyone that comes here to
				add
				something. Genuine reviews are what we’re after. If you have passion for a film, say so, if you hate it
				with a
				passion, say so.
